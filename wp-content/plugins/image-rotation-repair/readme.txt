== Description ==

The Image Rotation Repair plugin simply fixes image orientation based on EXIF data.  This is primarily a patch for mis-oriented images delivered from iPhones.  Functionally it filters all uploads and if EXIF->Orientation is set to a number greater than 1, then the image is resaved with a new orientation before the image is processed by wordpress.

*NEW* - supports postie plugin!
